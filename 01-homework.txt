1. Fibonacci

The Fibonacci series starts with 1, 1, and then each successive number is the sum of the
previous two. Write a script where you can supply a variable n that is an int, and the
program will calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

Eg: Fibonacci(5) = 5
    Fibonacci(20) = 6765


2. Square root

Write a script that can calculate the square root of a number n by trial and error.
Find a way to determine if your current best guess is too low, too high, or "close
enough," meaning that if you square your candidate number, then you get an answer
within 0.001 of the target n.
